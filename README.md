#Cat Clicker Project

This is part of my Udacity FEND program

##How it works

The counter increases according to the number of times the cat is clicked, therefore everytime the cat is clicked, the count should increase.

##Tools used to build the project

This was created using `JavaSript` `html` and `css`

##Running the project

To run the project, clone this repository onto your computer and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
Upon loading it, you are good to go :smiley:
